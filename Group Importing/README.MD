This file looks at how to use the API to create groups using a CSV file.

All these files require the ElvantoAPI python library. If you have pip installed you can install this using the following command from your command terminal

`pip install ElvantoAPI`

These are all written for Python 3.5 but should also work in Python 2.7.

Enter your API key into the `group-creator.py` file in line 4.

As long as you have a CSV file in the same format as `groups.csv` it will work. Unless you want to change the code, keep the heading names the same.
