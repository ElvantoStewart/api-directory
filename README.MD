This collection of Files has examples of things you can do with the Elvanto API.

All these files require the ElvantoAPI python library. If you have pip installed you can install this using the following command from your command terminal

`pip install ElvantoAPI`

These are all written for Python 3.5 but should also work in Python 2.7.

All modules work off the same API key, that can be set by editing the api_key.py file.
```key = "<YOUR API KEY HERE>"```
